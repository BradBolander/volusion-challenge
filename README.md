- Whatâ€™s the most amazing thing you ever built (work or personal)? Tell us what it was, why it was the most amazing thing ever, and what you learned.
  The most amazing I've built was the quickview component I built for The Tie Bar, it lead to a huge increase in conversions, and I'm proud of the sleek design and UX. I learned that
  I can make a huge impact on a company with great ideas and implementation.

- What are some technical blogs/podcasts/blogs/projects you follow? Tell us why we should do the same.
  There are a few blogs I follow, Scotch.io, Medium, and CSS-tricks, they all provide frequent articles on the latest trends in front end development.

- What could we do better at Volusion? It can be a feature/enhancement, a process, something on our website, or anything that caught your attention.
  One idea could be having a banner that shows if you're located in Austin, using geolocation, for an in-person e-commerce session, I think there could be some huge benefits to that.
