1) The most amazing I've built was the quickview component I built for The Tie Bar, it lead to a huge increase in conversions, and I'm proud of the sleek design and UX. I learned that
  I can make a huge impact on a company with great ideas and implementation.

2) There are a few blogs I follow, Scotch.io, Medium, and CSS-tricks, they all provide frequent articles on the latest trends in front end development.

3) One idea could be having a banner that shows if you're located in Austin, using geolocation, for an in-person e-commerce session, I think there could be some huge benefits to that.
